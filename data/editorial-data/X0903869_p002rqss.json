Is Poland still the most Catholic country in Europe?\n\nJoin our Warsaw correspondent, Adam Easton, as he travels to the beautiful medieval city of Krakow to find out.\n\nHe meets two young men who are training to become priests.  What's motivated their choice - and are there still enough others like them to keep the church going?\n\nFrom other young people, we find out what issues they have with faith and the church - and why in some ways, it was far simpler to be a believer under Communism.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-04-18T05:32:30+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Poland - The Catholic Church and Communism"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p002nrr1","title":"Poland","first_broadcast_date":"2009-04-11T05:32:30+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p002svt6","title":"The Tony Blair Faith Foundation part 1","first_broadcast_date":"2009-04-25T05:32:30+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p002rqv5","duration":1379,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[{"title":"Lech and Mieszko, who are training to be Catholic priests in Krakow in southern Poland.","content":"","link_title":"","link_uri":"","emp_playlist_uri":null,"emp_type":"video","published_image_uri":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/i/cc/ca/34e20a60a4411c0353d9d9e943a077184600.jpg","layout_arrangement":"image","position":0}],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"organisation","id":"p009fqdd","key":"catholic_church","title":"Catholic Church","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholic_Church"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g30c","key":"krak%C3%B3w","title":"Krak√≥w","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Krak%C3%B3w"},{"type":"format","id":"PT009","key":"magazinesandreviews","title":"Magazines & Reviews","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"place","id":"p007ls07","key":"poland","title":"Poland","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g2ws","key":"polish_communism","title":"Polish communism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polish_communism"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g309","key":"roman_catholicism_in_poland","title":"Roman Catholicism in Poland","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholicism_in_Poland"}]}}
