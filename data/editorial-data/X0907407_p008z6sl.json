But what of treatments?","long_synopsis":"Ten years after scientists decoded and sequenced the human genome, Professor Richard Dawkins looks at the transformation in research on diseases such as cancer, diabetes and malaria. \n\nWhen an international army of scientists announced that they had succeeded in reading out the entire genetic instruction manual for the human body, commentators declared the dawn of a new age in medicine. A decade on, the revolution has not yet affected the health care for most of us. So what has been happening behind the scenes in medical research labs, and how are we going to benefit?\n\nThe discovery of genes that play roles in conditions such as cancers, diabetes and heart disease has accelerated at a rapid rate since medical researchers gained access to the sequence of three billion molecular letters in the genetic book of life. The technology for analysing the genomes is becoming fast and relatively cheap. It took more than ten years and about one billion dollars to read the first human genome sequence. Now it takes a couple of weeks and a few thousand pounds. Before long it will cost just a few hundred pounds. Within a few years, it may be quick and cheap enough to offer us complete DNA scans as part of our routine health care.\n\nBut what would they be able to tell us?","first_broadcast_date":"2010-08-11T10:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Discovery","subtitle":"Age Of The Genome, Episode 3"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"series","pid":"p008r4k1","title":"Age Of The Genome","short_synopsis":"","position":null,"expected_child_count":4,"first_broadcast_date":"2010-07-28T10:32:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002w557","title":"Discovery","short_synopsis":"Explores today's most significant scientific discoveries.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-14T10:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p008vd45","title":"Episode 2","first_broadcast_date":"2010-08-04T10:32:00+01:00","position":2,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0092pvr","title":"Episode 4","first_broadcast_date":"2010-08-18T10:32:00+01:00","position":4,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p008z6w5","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"BBC News: Drug hope for advanced melanoma ","url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8076743.stm"},{"type":"related_site","title":"BBC News: Scientists ‘crack the entire genetic code’ of cancer","url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8414124.stm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Download this episode (mp3)","url":"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/discovery/discovery_20100811-1032a.mp3"},{"type":"related_site","title":"National Human Genome Research Institute ","url":"http://www.genome.gov/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Plexxikon","url":"http://www.plexxikon.com/view.cfm/1/Homepage"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Wellcome Trust Cancer Genome Project","url":"http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics ","url":"http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/groups"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p007mbgp","key":"dna","title":"DNA","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/DNA"},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00064","key":"scienceandnature","title":"Science & Nature","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007m64h","key":"gene","title":"Gene","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gene"},{"type":"subject","id":"p008m8rd","key":"genome","title":"Genome","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genome"},{"type":"subject","id":"p008m8rf","key":"genomics","title":"Genomics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genomics"},{"type":"subject","id":"p00522wt","key":"health_care","title":"Health care","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_care"},{"type":"subject","id":"p008m8rg","key":"human_genome","title":"Human genome","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_genome"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009j6f8","key":"human_genome_project","title":"Human Genome Project","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_Genome_Project"}]}}
