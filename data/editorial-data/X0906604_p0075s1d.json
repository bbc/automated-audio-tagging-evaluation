But its reputation is now badly damaged. \n\nIn Assignment we examine how this happened and whether the company has the means to get back on track.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-04-22T09:05:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Assignment ","subtitle":"Total recall: The Toyota story"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn0","title":"Assignment ","short_synopsis":"Investigations and journeys into the heart of global events from BBC correspondents","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T11:06:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00725n7","title":"Zimbabwe's New Farmers","first_broadcast_date":"2010-04-15T09:05:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0078p7g","title":"Inside Britain's Class System","first_broadcast_date":"2010-04-29T09:05:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0075s3x","duration":1500,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"Hitting home: Recall dulls Toyota's image","url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8501832.stm"},{"type":"related_site","title":"How do you stop a car with a jammed accelerator?","url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8498257.stm"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Q&A: Toyota recalls","url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8496902.stm"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Special report: Global car industry","url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/business/2009/carmakers/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Toyota's reputation could be tarnished for years","url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8498036.stm"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00052","key":"carsandmotors","title":"Cars & Motors","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00054","key":"consumer","title":"Consumer","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00079","key":"news","title":"News","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"organisation","id":"p007lt91","key":"toyota","title":"Toyota","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toyota"}]}}
