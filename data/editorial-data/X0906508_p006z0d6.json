People have died because they can't reach doctors or hospitals and malnutrition is increasing fast. Most significantly for a nation where tending livestock is central to its culture, untold millions of animals have died. Frozen carcasses of sheep and goats litter parts of the country. Linda Pressly travels to the remote far west of the country to report on this developing emergency. She asks what it means for Mongolia as rural refugees from the deep freeze have flooded to the capital, Ulan Bator. \nAnd she asks about the prospects of a brighter future with recent discovery of what may be the world's largest deposits of gold.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-04-08T12:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Crossing Continents","subtitle":"Mongolia's Deep Freeze "},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p0053dq2","title":"Crossing Continents","short_synopsis":"On the ground reporting from around the world","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2009-12-10T12:32:00Z","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p006x9vd","title":"The Children of Dushanbe ","first_broadcast_date":"2010-04-01T12:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00725nm","title":"Pentecostalists in Central America ","first_broadcast_date":"2010-04-15T12:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p006z0gq","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[{"title":"MONGOLIA'S DEEP FREEZE PICTURE GALLERY","content":"See the impact of Mongolia's harsh winter in Crossing Continents reporter Linda Pressly's photo gallery.","link_title":"View the photo gallery","link_uri":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8589629.stm","emp_playlist_uri":null,"emp_type":"video","published_image_uri":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/i/ac/22/8f91872aed2f4a11e686fbe86d1dee6e0b50.jpg","layout_arrangement":"promo","position":0},{"title":"SUBSCRIBE TO THE CROSSING CONTINENTS PODCAST","content":"Don't miss an episode of Crossing Continents, by subscribing to the free podcast.
