And Bill teaches that answers to all questions about how we got here can be found in the Old Testament of the Bible in the book of Genesis. \n\nKirk Johnson is a paleontologist at the museum, with evolution at the heart of all he does in his study of prehistoric life through fossils. Kirk decides that the time has come to talk to Bill about their different approaches to understanding the past. \n\nThis year has seen celebrations to mark two hundred years since the birth of the scientist Charles Darwin, whose work laid the foundations for the theory of evolution. \n\nIn Heart and Soul this week Frank Faulk of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation joins a group of schoolchildren on one of Bill Jackâ€™s Biblically Correct Tours at the museum and is there for the encounter between evolutionist and creationist.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-17T05:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Christian creationism 17/10/2009"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p004njln","title":"Beautiful Names 10/10/2009","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-10T05:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p004sqx7","title":"Bolivian Music 25/10/09","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-24T05:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p004jzcj","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[{"title":"Dinosaur skeleton remains","content":"","link_title":"","link_uri":"","emp_playlist_uri":null,"emp_type":"video","published_image_uri":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/i/84/15/236c1f09ac98bdb5d79da0a1838e07edae9c.jpg","layout_arrangement":"image","position":0}],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p009ck3r","key":"book_of_genesis","title":"Book of Genesis","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book_of_Genesis"},{"type":"person","id":"p007lkhy","key":"charles_darwin","title":"Charles Darwin","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Darwin"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lm2l","key":"christianity","title":"Christianity","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christianity"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009ck1l","key":"creationism","title":"Creationism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Creationism"},{"type":"place","id":"p009g63g","key":"denver_museum_of_nature_and_science","title":"Denver Museum of Nature and Science","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denver_Museum_of_Nature_and_Science"},{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion & Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p005ln1p","key":"evolution","title":"Evolution","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evolution"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g63j","key":"old_testament","title":"Old Testament","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Testament"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
