But it was created from known genetic sequences. \n\nRoland Pease looks beyond Synthia, at the work of biologists and chemists hoping to recreate life from scratch.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-09T10:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Discovery","subtitle":"Artificial Life"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002w557","title":"Discovery","short_synopsis":"Explores today's most significant scientific discoveries.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-14T10:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p007chm9","title":"Moments of Genius","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-05T10:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p007yj34","title":"The Cool Chain","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-16T10:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00833zp","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"'Artificial life' breakthrough announced by scientists","url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/science_and_environment/10132762.stm"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Gerald Joyce ","url":"http://www.scripps.edu/mb/joyce/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"J Craig Venter Institute  ","url":"http://www.jcvi.org/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"John Sutherland  ","url":"http://www.chemistry.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/show.html?ea=john.sutherland"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Philipp Holliger ","url":"http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/ph1/holliger.html"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Steve Benner ","url":"http://www.ffame.org/people/sbenner.html"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Synthetic life patents 'damaging'","url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/science_and_environment/10150685.stm"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Vincent Noireaux  ","url":"http://www.physics.umn.edu/people/noireaux.html"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p007mt17","key":"artificial_intelligence","title":"Artificial intelligence","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artificial_intelligence"},{"type":"person","id":"p009gx7f","key":"craig_venter","title":"Craig Venter","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Craig_Venter"},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00064","key":"scienceandnature","title":"Science & Nature","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lkcd","key":"genetics","title":"Genetics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genetics"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009hfvf","key":"synthetic_biology","title":"Synthetic biology","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Synthetic_biology"}]}}
