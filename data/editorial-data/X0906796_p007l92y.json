Their work is so sensitive that few are prepared to talk about it.  \n\nBut for this programme - our religious affairs correspondent, Christopher Landau - has persuaded some of them to speak: the missionaries who carry the gospel to countries which are hostile to Christian mission.\n\nCountries where evangelising may put them, and those they lead to Christ, in mortal danger. Hear their stories, and find out about the huge ethical dilemmas they face.\n\nAnd discover how their work looks from a Muslim perspective.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-19T12:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Dangerous Mission "},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p007gvhq","title":"Muslim Scots 12/05/2010","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-12T12:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p007yj3d","title":"Colombian Hostages 09/06/2010","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-09T12:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p007l95g","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p007lm2l","key":"christianity","title":"Christianity","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christianity"},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g49l","key":"evangelism","title":"Evangelism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evangelism"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g49f","key":"mission_(christian)","title":"Mission (Christian)","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mission_%28Christian%29"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g49h","key":"missionary","title":"Missionary","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missionary"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
