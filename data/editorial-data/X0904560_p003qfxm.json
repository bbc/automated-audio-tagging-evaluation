Run?! \n\nLuckily for us, David Attenborough stood his ground and became one of the first people to film and document the life of the Komodo Dragon. \n\nThese giant lizards live on the relatively small island of Komodo in Indonesia and Sir David recounts his utter amazement encountering such a formidable creature. \n\nIf solving the riddle of what they eat on the island wasn’t intriguing enough, Sir David also recounts the revelation when he discovered that females don’t really need males, because they can produce off-spring by cloning themselves.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-07-25T11:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Letter From...","subtitle":"25/07/2009"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002wv05","title":"Letter From...","short_synopsis":"A topical audio essay by a leading commentator from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2009-01-03T18:06:00Z","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p003mdb7","title":"18/07/2009","first_broadcast_date":"2009-07-18T11:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p003s78h","title":"...India","first_broadcast_date":"2009-08-01T11:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p003qfzw","duration":480,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"genre","id":"C00190","key":"natureandenvironment","title":"Nature & Environment","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00064","key":"scienceandnature","title":"Science & Nature","broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p004jnmx","key":"komodo_dragon","title":"Komodo dragon","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Komodo_dragon"},{"type":"format","id":"PT013","key":"readings","title":"Readings","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
