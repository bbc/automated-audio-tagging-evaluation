From that time, stringent religious laws were imposed and politics, culture and religion became inextricably linked. \n\nHeart and Soul examines how this has affected attitudes towards Islam among those who have left the country.\n\nThe anthropologist and writer Ziba Mir Hosseini left Iran in the 1980s and has spent the last three decades trying to make sense of her personal view of faith. She talks to fellow Iranians - some who have rejected their religion, others who have created their own spiritual path - but all who have been marked by the creation of the Islamic Republic of Iran.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-03-28T02:32:30Z","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Iran"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p002dl4x","title":"Heart and Soul","first_broadcast_date":"2009-03-21T02:32:30Z","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p002mbyq","title":"Money Iceland","first_broadcast_date":"2009-04-04T05:32:30+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p002h47f","duration":1379,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"place","id":"p007mhgh","key":"glasgow","title":"Iran","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007l634","key":"islam","title":"Islam","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Islam"},{"type":"format","id":"PT009","key":"magazinesandreviews","title":"Magazines & Reviews","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009cmj6","key":"religious_law","title":"Religious law","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_law"},{"type":"person","id":"p009cmj4","key":"ruhollah_khomeini","title":"Ruhollah Khomeini","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ruhollah_Khomeini"}]}}
