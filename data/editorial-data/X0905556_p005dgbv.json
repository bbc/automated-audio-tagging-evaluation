His trademark badge depicts the Black Madonna of Czestochowa, showing his devotion to the Virgin Mary and the Catholic church.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-12-02T12:32:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Poland: the Catholic church and the fall of Communism 02/12/2009"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0053gbp","title":"The Black Cube 25/11/2009","first_broadcast_date":"2009-11-25T12:32:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p005dgd8","title":"Poland: still the most Catholic country in Europe? 09/12/2009 ","first_broadcast_date":"2009-12-09T12:32:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p005dgbw","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p009g79n","key":"black_madonna_of_cz%C4%99stochowa","title":"Black Madonna of Częstochowa","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Madonna_of_Cz%C4%99stochowa"},{"type":"organisation","id":"p009fqdd","key":"catholic_church","title":"Catholic Church","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholic_Church"},{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion & Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"place","id":"p007ltkp","key":"eastern_europe","title":"Eastern Europe","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eastern_Europe"},{"type":"place","id":"p007ls07","key":"poland","title":"Poland","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g2ws","key":"polish_communism","title":"Polish communism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polish_communism"},{"type":"person","id":"p009g2wy","key":"pope_john_paul_ii","title":"Pope John Paul II","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_John_Paul_II"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g309","key":"roman_catholicism_in_poland","title":"Roman Catholicism in Poland","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholicism_in_Poland"},{"type":"place","id":"p009g2y4","key":"warsaw","title":"Warsaw","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warsaw"}]}}
