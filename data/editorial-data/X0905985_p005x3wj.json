Then a passionate re-conversion to her Catholic faith in her 50s changed everything - out went the vampires and in came fictionalised biographies of Christ and her most recent novel, Angel Time, featuring a guardian angel who comes to save the soul of a hitman. \n\nBut Anne Rice sees a thread through her work rather than a radical departure - the vampires who agonise about the source of their own evil are tormented souls cut off from the love of God and the possibility of redemption, as she was when she wrote about them.  \n\nAt home in Palm Springs, California, Anne Rice talks to Bidisha about how her beliefs have shaped her fiction.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-01-27T12:32:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Spiritual Journeys, Anne Rice"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"series","pid":"p005x3tz","title":"Spiritual Journeys","short_synopsis":"","position":null,"expected_child_count":3,"first_broadcast_date":"2010-01-27T12:32:00Z","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}}}},"peers":{"previous":null,"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p005zyns","title":"Episode 2","first_broadcast_date":"2010-02-03T12:32:00Z","position":2,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p005x3z2","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"www.annerice.com","url":"http://www.annerice.com/"}],"supporting_content_items":[{"title":"Gallery","content":"","link_title":"Bidisha meets Anne Rice","link_uri":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/arts/2010/01/100120_heartandsoul_gallery.shtml","emp_playlist_uri":null,"emp_type":"video","published_image_uri":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/i/6c/7b/4a934ac5277dbe979e2643176aaa7e461a8b.jpg","layout_arrangement":"promo","position":0}],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"person","id":"p007mmtr","key":"anne_rice","title":"Anne Rice","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anne_Rice"},{"type":"place","id":"p0038tc7","key":"california","title":"California","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/California"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007l636","key":"catholicism","title":"Catholicism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholicism"},{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion & Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"place","id":"p009g7w8","key":"palm_springs%2C_california","title":"Palm Springs, California","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palm_Springs%2C_California"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g7ws","key":"salvation","title":"Salvation","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salvation"},{"type":"subject","id":"p006gl6m","key":"vampire","title":"Vampire","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vampire"}]}}
