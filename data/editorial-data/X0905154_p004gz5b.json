Those convicted of a third strike get 25 years to life.","long_synopsis":"Fifteen years ago, following the brutal murders of two girls by repeat offenders, Californians voted overwhelmingly in favour of a tough new crime measure. Under the 'three strikes’ law, criminals convicted of a second serious offence must serve double the normal sentence. Those convicted of a third strike, get 25 years to life. What makes the law different from similar laws in other states is that the third strike does not have to be a serious or violent crime.  One inmate is serving life for stealing a pair of socks when aged 19. Now a group of law students at Stanford Law School are fighting to get some of the 'third strike lifers' released. For Assignment, Rob Walker investigates one of these cases: a Vietnam veteran sentenced to life for possession of 0.03 grams of heroin. And we meet the families of the murdered girls. They helped draft the three strikes law – but are now bitterly divided among themselves about its impact.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-08T09:05:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Assignment ","subtitle":"Three Strike Lifers"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn0","title":"Assignment ","short_synopsis":"Investigations and journeys into the heart of global events from BBC correspondents","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T11:06:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p004cdrn","title":"The Mystery of the Arctic Sea","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-01T09:05:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p004j7zg","title":"Armenia: the cleverest nation on earth","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-15T09:05:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p004gz80","duration":1500,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"place","id":"p0038tc7","key":"california","title":"California","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/California"},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00079","key":"news","title":"News","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"organisation","id":"p009bf7q","key":"stanford_law_school","title":"Stanford Law School","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stanford_Law_School"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009bf7m","key":"three_strikes_law","title":"Three strikes law","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Three_strikes_law"}]}}
