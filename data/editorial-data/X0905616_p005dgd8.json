Is Poland still the most Catholic country in Europe?\n\nJoin our Warsaw correspondent, Adam Easton, as he travels to the beautiful medieval city of Krakow to find out.\n\nHe meets two young men who are training to become priests.  What's motivated their choice - and are there still enough others like them to keep the church going?\n\nFrom other young people, we find out what issues they have with faith and the church - and why in some ways, it was far simpler to be a believer under Communism.\n\n\nBelow: Lech and Mieszko, who are training to be Catholic priests in Krakow in southern Poland.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-12-09T12:32:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Poland: still the most Catholic country in Europe? 09/12/2009 "},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p005dgbv","title":"Poland: the Catholic church and the fall of Communism 02/12/2009","first_broadcast_date":"2009-12-02T12:32:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p004gzq5","title":"Muslim Televangelists","first_broadcast_date":"2009-12-16T12:32:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p005dgd9","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"organisation","id":"p009fqdd","key":"catholic_church","title":"Catholic Church","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholic_Church"},{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion & Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g30c","key":"krak%C3%B3w","title":"Krak√≥w","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Krak%C3%B3w"},{"type":"place","id":"p007ls07","key":"poland","title":"Poland","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g2ws","key":"polish_communism","title":"Polish communism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polish_communism"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g309","key":"roman_catholicism_in_poland","title":"Roman Catholicism in Poland","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholicism_in_Poland"},{"type":"place","id":"p009g2y4","key":"warsaw","title":"Warsaw","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warsaw"}]}}
