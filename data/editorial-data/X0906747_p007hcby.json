How much are they about fundamentalist Islam? And how much are they a reaction to continuing \"feudalism\" - the dominance of economics, politics and society by a handful of powerful families?  \n\nListen as Owen travels across the country, meeting both feudal landowners and the young Punjabis who are attracted by the lure of militancy.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-13T09:05:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Assignment ","subtitle":"A Taliban Class War?"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn0","title":"Assignment ","short_synopsis":"Investigations and journeys into the heart of global events from BBC correspondents","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T11:06:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p007czjs","title":"Goldmine Sachs","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-06T09:05:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p007m8vv","title":"Swine Flu: Panic or Pandemic?","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-20T09:05:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p007hcfg","duration":1500,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"HARDtalk: Mark Sedwill - Nato's civilian representative in Afghanistan","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p007kqsw"},{"type":"related_site","title":"In Depth: Taliban conflict","url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/south_asia/afghanistan_pakistan/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Pakistan inequality fuelling Taliban support","url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8681024.stm"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00060","key":"history","title":"History","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00079","key":"news","title":"News","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"place","id":"p007m9sz","key":"pakistan","title":"Pakistan","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pakistan"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
