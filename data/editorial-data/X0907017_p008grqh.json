His father is a well-known theologian.\n\nAs a child, Jide loved church more than playing with his friends.\n\nBut around the age of 11, he began to become aware that he was different from other boys.\n\nMuch to his horror, he realised that he was gay.\n\nIn conversation with Michael Ford, Jide recalls the inner conflicts he went through as a teenager and a young man, in a country where it is almost inconceivable that anyone can be both a committed Christian and homosexual.  \n\nWe hear how he learnt to embrace his orientation after a failed marriage.\n\nLeaving behind the deep shame he had felt, he founded a church for gay and lesbian people in Lagos: the House of Rainbow.\n\nDriven out of the country by death threats, Jide now continues his ministry to African gay and lesbian Christians from his home in London, through a vibrant \"virtual\" church.  He has become a well-known voice in Africa and beyond.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-07-07T12:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Fame, Blame And Shame, Episode 3"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"series","pid":"p0085dx5","title":"Fame, Blame And Shame","short_synopsis":"","position":null,"expected_child_count":3,"first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-23T12:32:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0088v2w","title":"Episode 2","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-30T12:32:00+01:00","position":2,"media_type":null},"next":null},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p008grt3","duration":1500,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"Assignment: Gay Pride and Prejudice in Kenya","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0082kx8"},{"type":"related_site","title":"House of Rainbow","url":"http://www.houseofrainbow.org/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Religion, politics and Africa's homophobia","url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8528409.stm"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009c3qc","key":"homophobia","title":"Homophobia","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homophobia"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lkb8","key":"homosexuality","title":"Homosexuality","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homosexuality"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lkbh","key":"lagos","title":"Lagos","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lagos"},{"type":"place","id":"p007lv14","key":"nigeria","title":"Nigeria","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nigeria"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g492","key":"pentecostalism","title":"Pentecostalism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pentecostalism"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
