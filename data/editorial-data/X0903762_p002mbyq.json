More than 90% of people are said to be Christian - the overwhelming majority Lutheran, the state religion. \n\nHEART AND SOUL examines the role of the National church of Iceland during the \"good times\", and how it is responding to the country's collapse. RICHARD COLES asks whether this is an opportunity for it to have a real say in the country's future, or whether it signals an end to the influence of the national church.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-04-04T05:32:30+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Money Iceland"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p002h45s","title":"Iran","first_broadcast_date":"2009-03-28T02:32:30Z","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p002nrr1","title":"Poland","first_broadcast_date":"2009-04-11T05:32:30+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p002mc60","duration":1589,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[{"title":"Richard Coles in Iceland","content":"","link_title":"","link_uri":"","emp_playlist_uri":null,"emp_type":"video","published_image_uri":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/i/09/04/d851a739784b2ac15946c0745ae139356f28.jpg","layout_arrangement":"image","position":0}],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p009cmqj","key":"2008–2009_icelandic_financial_crisis","title":"2008–2009 Icelandic financial crisis","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/2008%E2%80%932009_Icelandic_financial_crisis"},{"type":"organisation","id":"p009cmqg","key":"church_of_iceland","title":"Church of Iceland","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_Iceland"},{"type":"place","id":"p007ms5m","key":"iceland","title":"Iceland","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iceland"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009cmql","key":"lutheranism","title":"Lutheranism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lutheranism"},{"type":"format","id":"PT009","key":"magazinesandreviews","title":"Magazines & Reviews","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009cmqn","key":"state_religion","title":"State religion","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/State_religion"}]}}
