His successor Tony Blair of the Labour Party also promised to rid Britain of the class system which had once divided the country so that only those with money, connections and the right background were able to fulfill their potential.  \n\nBut in 2010 government analysis suggests that the richest 10% of the population are more than 100 times better off than the poorest 10% of society.  Next week Britain will vote in a new government - all the main political parties are promising a fairer society but why is Britain still so unequal...is it the class system? \n\nIn this week's Assignment we visited four families in four different areas of England to find out what they think.
