A new generation of players are bringing God back on to the pitch.","long_synopsis":"The cliche may have it that football is the new religion; but a new generation of football players are bringing God back onto the pitch. \n\nMost famously, the Brazilian player, Kaka, has on several occasions celebrated his victories by revealing a T-shirt, which reads \"I Belong To Jesus\". \n\nFaith can play an important part in a player's life. In African football, traditional belief systems, such as juju, have long been associated with the game. Now new Christian movements are displacing juju in Africa. And everywhere they are showing signs of wanting to play a bigger role in football.\n\nBut Fifa, the international regulatory body, would rather religion stayed out of football. They have warned they will not tolerate any expressions of religion, such as those professed by Kaka, on the pitch during this month's World Cup in South Africa. \n\nFifa argues that football's power to unite could be threatened if it does not remain secular.\n\nPhotograph of Kaka copyright Getty Images.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-16T12:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Is there room for God on the football pitch?"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p007yj3d","title":"Colombian Hostages 09/06/2010","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-09T12:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p008lyg3","title":"Japan's Buddhist temple bells","first_broadcast_date":"2010-07-14T12:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00821g5","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"Africa Kicks ","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/documentaries/2010/01/100108_africa_kicks_one.shtml"},{"type":"related_site","title":"In the Shadow of the Stadium","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/documentaries/2010/05/100526_shadow_stadium.shtml"},{"type":"related_site","title":"The Power and the Passion","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/documentaries/2010/06/100603_the_power_and_the_passion.shtml"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p007lkbz","key":"2010_fifa_world_cup","title":"2010 FIFA World Cup","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/2010_FIFA_World_Cup"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lldf","key":"football","title":"Association football","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Association_football"},{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion & Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p008rjvs","key":"faith","title":"Faith","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Faith"},{"type":"organisation","id":"p007m2pv","key":"fifa","title":"FIFA","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/FIFA"},{"type":"subject","id":"p008rjvq","key":"juju","title":"Juju","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Juju"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p008rjvy","key":"secularity","title":"Secularity","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Secularity"}]}}
