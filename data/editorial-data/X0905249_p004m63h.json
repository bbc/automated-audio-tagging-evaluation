Social workers across the country found themselves under siege, demonised by the public and the media. Bound by the confidentiality and sensitivity of the cases they handle, social workers seldom have a chance to put their side of the story. Assignment gets a rare insight into the work of one child protection department to hear how they are coping with the pressure. We go with them to meet the families they try to change and they tell us of the difficult judgements they have to make and how they must balance dangers to children against scant resources available and a bureaucracy that often seems stacked against them.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-22T09:05:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Assignment ","subtitle":"Protecting Britain's Children"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn0","title":"Assignment ","short_synopsis":"Investigations and journeys into the heart of global events from BBC correspondents","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T11:06:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p004j7zg","title":"Armenia: the cleverest nation on earth","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-15T09:05:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p004t2c1","title":"Dying to Give Birth","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-29T10:05:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p004m665","duration":1500,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p007m3qm","key":"child_abuse","title":"Child abuse","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child_abuse"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lt3b","key":"child_protection","title":"Child protection","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child_protection"},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00079","key":"news","title":"News","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007m8l6","key":"social_work","title":"Social work","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_work"}]}}
