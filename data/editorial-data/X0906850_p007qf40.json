This was the first X-ray, taken by Wilhelm Roentgen of his wife Bertha. It sparked a worldwide trend for DIY X-ray kits, until the dangers emerged. Mark Lythgoe explains how seeing living skeletons revolutionised our view of the body.\n\nOne of the most iconic images produced by X-rays is that of the double helix of DNA, the stuff of life itself.  The famous twisting simplicity has captivated architects and designers ever since it was first discovered by Watson and Crick. Mark examines the cultural impact of this iconic image and assesses the implications its discovery has had on crime fiction.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-26T10:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Discovery","subtitle":"Images That Changed The World, X-ray and The Double Helix"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"series","pid":"p007qf2x","title":"Images That Changed The World","short_synopsis":"","position":null,"expected_child_count":2,"first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-26T10:32:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002w557","title":"Discovery","short_synopsis":"Explores today's most significant scientific discoveries.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-14T10:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}}}},"peers":{"previous":null,"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p007tyj0","title":"Episode 2","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-02T10:32:00+01:00","position":2,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p007qf6l","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"Audio slideshow: The first X-rays","url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8479609.stm"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p007lxr6","key":"crime_fiction","title":"Crime fiction","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crime_fiction"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007mbgp","key":"dna","title":"DNA","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/DNA"},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009hkyg","key":"double_helix","title":"Double helix","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Double_helix"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00064","key":"scienceandnature","title":"Science & Nature","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009hky7","key":"medical_imaging","title":"Medical imaging","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medical_imaging"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009hkyp","key":"skeletons","title":"Skeleton","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skeleton"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009hkyt","key":"watson_and_crick","title":"Watson and Crick","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Watson_and_Crick"},{"type":"person","id":"p009hkyk","key":"wilhelm_r%C3%B6ntgen","title":"Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen"},{"type":"subject","id":"p0080v4h","key":"x-ray","title":"X-ray","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/X-ray"}]}}
