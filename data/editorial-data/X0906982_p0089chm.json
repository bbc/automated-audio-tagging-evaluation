Legal citizens say they will be targeted by police just because of their skin. \n\nFor Assignment Rob Walker travels to Arizona to explore why immigration has become such a hot political issue in the state.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-07-01T12:05:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Assignment ","subtitle":"Arizona's Immigration Law SB1070"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn0","title":"Assignment ","short_synopsis":"Investigations and journeys into the heart of global events from BBC correspondents","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T11:06:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0085yx4","title":"Spain's hard times","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-24T12:05:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p008gs0c","title":"The Families of Manshiyet Nasser","first_broadcast_date":"2010-07-08T12:05:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0089cl3","duration":1500,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[{"title":"In depth: United States immigration","content":"World Update's Dan Damon in London and Madeleine Morris in Washington take an in depth look at immigration reform in the United States, with contributions from: undocumented workers in Maryland; Congressman Luis Gutierrez of Illinios and Lamar Smith of Texas; and a leading advocate of an amnesty for illegal farm workers in the US.","link_title":"In depth: United States immigration","link_uri":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/news/2010/05/100520_immigration_wup_sl.shtml","emp_playlist_uri":null,"emp_type":"video","published_image_uri":null,"layout_arrangement":"promo","position":0}],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"place","id":"p0060tmz","key":"arizona","title":"Arizona","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arizona"},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lrjv","key":"illegal_immigration","title":"Illegal immigration","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illegal_immigration"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009cjvv","key":"illegal_immigration_to_the_united_states","title":"Illegal immigration to the United States","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00079","key":"news","title":"News","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
