They are struck on the side by a suspended tree trunk, swung by teams of up to twenty monks. Some are ancient – one bell featured was cast in the year 752.\n\nCasting a large bell in bronze is a perilous business with a high chance of failure, and Ikko Iwasawa who runs the foundry which cast the largest bell in Japan explains the mystery and ritual as a new bell is being cast. \n\nThe head priest of Rengein Monastery, whose bell can be heard 30 miles away, reveals their spiritual meaning and the impact they have on people.\n\nThe programme weaves Japanese haiku poems and interviews with the sounds of famous bells in the cities and countryside, each with its unique voice.\n\nProducer: Julian May\n\nAbove: Priest of the temple where the bell will be hung leading prayers during the casting ceremony","first_broadcast_date":"2010-03-03T12:32:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Japan's Buddhist temple bells"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p005qznm","title":"13/01/2010 The Whoop","first_broadcast_date":"2010-01-13T12:32:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p006hrrr","title":"The Mourner's Kaddish ","first_broadcast_date":"2010-03-10T12:32:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p006dg6s","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[{"title":"CASTING THE TEMPLE BELLS ","content":"Molten bronze in crucible awaits pouring into the mould as commissioning priest discusses with casting director (hard hat) the next stage","link_title":"","link_uri":"","emp_playlist_uri":null,"emp_type":"video","published_image_uri":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/i/3d/16/9462610defe6fa713f54c60821f64cd3dc61.jpg","layout_arrangement":"image","position":0},{"title":"The mould is lowered into position to receive the molten bronze","content":"","link_title":"","link_uri":"","emp_playlist_uri":null,"emp_type":"video","published_image_uri":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/i/7c/64/399b48f89c48fccbabec504255640255e07c.jpg","layout_arrangement":"image","position":0},{"title":"Pouring of molten bronze into the mould","content":"","link_title":"","link_uri":"","emp_playlist_uri":null,"emp_type":"video","published_image_uri":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/i/c2/8d/f76d76d30f2ae8ffe83e316c25b33ba8964f.jpg","layout_arrangement":"image","position":0}],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p009gszz","key":"bell_(instrument)","title":"Bell (instrument)","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_(instrument)"},{"type":"subject","id":"p006dbv5","key":"buddhism","title":"Buddhism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buddhism"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009gszw","key":"buddhism_in_japan","title":"Buddhism in Japan","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buddhism_in_Japan"},{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion & Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007m9tk","key":"haiku","title":"Haiku","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haiku"},{"type":"place","id":"p007lxfs","key":"japan","title":"Japan","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
