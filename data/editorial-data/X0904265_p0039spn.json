It's an idea that's growing in popularity in the United States and has spread through the Pentecostal wing of Christianity across Africa. Heart and Soul examines \"the Word of Faith, Health and Wealth\". Followers argue that it inspires believers to get better jobs and to fulfil their potential; critics that it equates faith with money, and has directly contributed to the current financial crisis. As the world recession deepens, and debt and unemployment increase in the United States, Richard Coles ask what happens to a belief system that puts so much emphasis on the philosophy that God wants his followers to be wealthy.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-06-13T05:32:30+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Money - Name It And Claim It"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0037mgb","title":"Heart & Soul","first_broadcast_date":"2009-06-06T05:32:30+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p003g44k","title":"Undercover Missionaries","first_broadcast_date":"2009-06-20T05:32:30+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0039sr0","duration":1589,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[{"title":"Pastor Jamal Bryant at Empowerment Temple","content":"","link_title":"","link_uri":"","emp_playlist_uri":null,"emp_type":"video","published_image_uri":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/i/5f/34/85ab4440c46e4f0abd51159929986c077974.jpg","layout_arrangement":"image","position":0}],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p009bz7n","key":"global_financial_crisis_of_2008-2009","title":"Global financial crisis of 2008â€“2009","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Global_financial_crisis_of_2008%E2%80%932009"},{"type":"format","id":"PT009","key":"magazinesandreviews","title":"Magazines & Reviews","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g492","key":"pentecostalism","title":"Pentecostalism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pentecostalism"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g490","key":"prosperity_theology","title":"Prosperity theology","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prosperity_theology"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p006cwvv","key":"united_states","title":"United States","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States"}]}}
