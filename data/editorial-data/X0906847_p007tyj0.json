He visits one of the pioneers of modern brain scanning at Nottingham University, and asks neuroscientists and philosophers why picturing the mind in action has sparked controversy between the fields of science and philosophy.\n\nAnd he examines the wider impact of perhaps the most emotional medical image of them all â€“ the foetal ultrasound.  When a technique used in the shipping industry was first applied to seeing an unborn baby, the image was fuzzy, but the implications went far beyond medicine. Mark assesses the wider cultural impact of foetal ultrasound and hears from one of the early pioneers that 3D imaging has changed his views on the legal abortion limit.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-02T10:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Discovery","subtitle":"Images That Changed The World, Episode 2"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"series","pid":"p007qf2x","title":"Images That Changed The World","short_synopsis":"","position":null,"expected_child_count":2,"first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-26T10:32:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002w557","title":"Discovery","short_synopsis":"Explores today's most significant scientific discoveries.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-14T10:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p007qf40","title":"X-ray and The Double Helix","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-26T10:32:00+01:00","position":1,"media_type":null},"next":null},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p007tyln","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00064","key":"scienceandnature","title":"Science & Nature","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009hky7","key":"medical_imaging","title":"Medical imaging","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medical_imaging"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009hl40","key":"mind","title":"Mind","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mind"},{"type":"subject","id":"p008qhmh","key":"neuroimaging","title":"Neuroimaging","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neuroimaging"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lzt8","key":"neuroscience","title":"Neuroscience","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neuroscience"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009hgd9","key":"philosophy_of_science","title":"Philosophy of science","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy_of_science"},{"type":"subject","id":"p004hdgg","key":"ultrasound","title":"Ultrasound","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ultrasound"},{"type":"organisation","id":"p009hl42","key":"university_of_nottingham","title":"University of Nottingham","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Nottingham"}]}}
