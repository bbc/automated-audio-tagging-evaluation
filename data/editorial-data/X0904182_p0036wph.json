Delves-Broughton was a successful British journalist working abroad but gave it all up to go to Harvard to see what business school was like. \n\nPeter Day hears about his experience from trying to stay ‘ahead of the curve’ to the method of teaching, by studying 700 case studies over the 2 year course and keeping up with his classmates most of who were much more experienced than himself. \n\nFormer alumni include Michael Bloomberg, Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric and Lou Gerstner of IBM. Whilst giving graduates a great network of contacts and self confidence, does it also insulate them from the outside world?","first_broadcast_date":"2009-06-02T09:06:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Global Business","subtitle":"Philip Delves-Broughton "},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsyy","title":"Global Business","short_synopsis":"Insights into the business world from the BBC","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T02:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0034ffs","title":"Craig Barrett","first_broadcast_date":"2009-05-26T09:06:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0038ynr","title":"Lazy Town ","first_broadcast_date":"2009-06-09T09:06:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0036wrc","duration":1379,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"Philip Delves-Broughton ","url":"http://www.philipdelvesbroughton.com"}],"supporting_content_items":[{"title":"Contributor to this programme","content":"Philip Delves-Broughton \u000d\nAuthor of 'What they teach you at Harvard Business School'","link_title":null,"link_uri":null,"emp_playlist_uri":null,"emp_type":"video","published_image_uri":null,"layout_arrangement":"text","position":0},{"title":"Peter's Web Comment","content":"Matters of Degree: Inside Harvard Business School","link_title":"","link_uri":"","emp_playlist_uri":null,"emp_type":"video","published_image_uri":null,"layout_arrangement":"promo","position":0}],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p006gl1f","key":"business","title":"Business","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business"},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00051","key":"money","title":"Money","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
