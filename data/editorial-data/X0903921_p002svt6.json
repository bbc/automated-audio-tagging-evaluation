But will his plans amount to anything - or is he too divisive a figure to promote collaboration?","long_synopsis":"During his ten years as Prime Minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair was deliberately discreet about his religious faith.  His press spokesman famously said \"we don't do God\".  \n\nBut now, having left office, Tony Blair is setting up the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, designed to bring people of different religious faiths together, to promote dialogue and work collaboratively on development projects. \n\nChristopher Landau has been given exclusive access to Tony Blair and his team as they travel to the USA and begin their work.  In the first programme, we follow Tony Blair's battle to encourage a secularising world to take faith seriously.  \n\nHe now runs a \"Faith and Globalisation\" course at Yale University, and plans to build a centre for inter-faith dialogue in London. But will his plans amount to anything - or is he too divisive a figure to promote inter-faith collaboration?","first_broadcast_date":"2009-04-25T05:32:30+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"The Tony Blair Faith Foundation part 1"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p002rqss","title":"Poland - The Catholic Church and Communism","first_broadcast_date":"2009-04-18T05:32:30+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p002ysbx","title":"The Tony Blair Faith Foundation part 2","first_broadcast_date":"2009-05-02T05:32:30+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p002svvk","duration":1379,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT009","key":"magazinesandreviews","title":"Magazines & Reviews","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lk96","key":"religion","title":"Religion","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religion"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g3xv","key":"religious_toleration","title":"Religious toleration","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_toleration"},{"type":"subject","id":"p008rjvy","key":"secularity","title":"Secularity","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Secularity"},{"type":"person","id":"p007ltsb","key":"tony_blair","title":"Tony Blair","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Blair"},{"type":"place","id":"p009g3xs","key":"tony_blair_faith_foundation","title":"Tony Blair Faith Foundation","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Blair_Faith_Foundation"}]}}
