Heart and Soul follows the journey of the river from Haridawar to the Bay of Bengal.","long_synopsis":"In 2008, the Ganges was named India's national river. It is also known as the Hindu mother goddess Ganga, who gives life and salvation. \n\nIn January 2010, the Ganges played host to the world's largest gathering of people, who congregated at the city of Haridawar - the point at which the river descends from the Himalayan plains - for the Hindu festival of Ardha Kumbla. \n\nTaking this as its starting point, the series will journey down the Ganges towards its delta in the Bay of Bengal, collecting sounds and stories from among the 400 million or so who live and work on it, day in, day out.\n\nIn the city of Varanasi we hear the stories of two river boat men. \n\nBhaiyalal has been ferrying passengers across the river all his working life, taking them from temple to temple in this city of pilgrimage and tourism.\n\nIn an attempt to combat the rising tide of pollution that continually threatens to drown out the river, Bhaiyalal built a boat out of plastic bottles that he has collected from the Ganges. \n\nHe believes it is the smallest boat on the river and now uses it to carry one person at a time. \n\nIn the same city, Bhuvam also works as a boatman, amazing visitors with songs from the Indian classical tradition as he rows. \n\nDuring his years on the river, Bhuvam has listened to and learnt from the music of artists who come to perform in the city, and now adds his voice to the rich sounds that emerge from the Ganges' waters. He has become a local tourist attraction in his own right.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-04-14T12:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Ganga Ma - Voices Of The River, Episode 2"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"series","pid":"p006ygpj","title":"Ganga Ma - Voices Of The River","short_synopsis":"","position":null,"expected_child_count":2,"first_broadcast_date":"2010-04-07T12:32:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p006ygqy","title":"Episode 1","first_broadcast_date":"2010-04-07T12:32:00+01:00","position":1,"media_type":null},"next":null},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0071prl","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p003h5x1","key":"bay_of_bengal","title":"Bay of Bengal","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bay_of_Bengal"},{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion & Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p008z1sh","key":"ganges","title":"Ganges","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ganges"},{"type":"place","id":"p009gt7j","key":"haridwar","title":"Haridwar","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haridwar"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lw0b","key":"hinduism","title":"Hinduism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hinduism"},{"type":"place","id":"p003vbdv","key":"india","title":"India","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/India"},{"type":"subject","id":"p0080vmt","key":"mother_goddess","title":"Mother goddess","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother_goddess"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lly2","key":"pilgrimage","title":"Pilgrimage","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pilgrimage"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007mnr3","key":"religious_festival","title":"Religious festival","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_festival"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lrqv","key":"tourism","title":"Tourism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tourism"},{"type":"place","id":"p009gt7n","key":"varanasi","title":"Varanasi","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Varanasi"}]}}
