It is the holiest shrine of Islam, encircled by millions of pilgrims every year, and tradition asserts it was built by Abraham on the foundations of the first house of Adam.\n\nIn Heart & Soul â€“ The Black Cube, Navid Akhtar looks at the ways the Black Cube has intersected with Western culture, from the work of painters like the Russian constructivist Malevich, to our desire for simplified geometric buildings. He discovers connections between the rituals of the pilgrimage to Mecca and Western thought.\n\nThe Ka'aba at The Holy Mosque in Makkah,  courtesy of Abdulrahman AlMutairi","first_broadcast_date":"2009-11-25T12:32:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"The Black Cube 25/11/2009"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0053dgw","title":"New Jewish life in Berlin 18/11/2009","first_broadcast_date":"2009-11-18T12:32:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p005dgbv","title":"Poland: the Catholic church and the fall of Communism 02/12/2009","first_broadcast_date":"2009-12-02T12:32:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0053gf7","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"person","id":"p008qz86","key":"abraham","title":"Abraham","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abraham"},{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion & Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007l634","key":"islam","title":"Islam","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Islam"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g75f","key":"kaaba","title":"Kaaba","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kaaba"},{"type":"person","id":"p009g75y","key":"kazimir_malevich","title":"Kazimir Malevich","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kazimir_Malevich"},{"type":"place","id":"p008ctq8","key":"mecca","title":"Mecca","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mecca"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lly2","key":"pilgrimage","title":"Pilgrimage","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pilgrimage"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"place","id":"p007lqxk","key":"saudi_arabia","title":"Saudi Arabia","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saudi_Arabia"},{"type":"subject","id":"p0080wq4","key":"shrine","title":"Shrine","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shrine"}]}}
