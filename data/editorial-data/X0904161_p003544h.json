It was also the capital of an empire that ruled half the known world - yet it was new, built from nothing. \n\nThe religion that ruled the city was new too - Islam was only 150 years old, still developing and still at work to the ways human beings would live out the message the Prophet brought from God. \n\nIn this series, Francis Spufford explores the legacies which Baghadad at its high point gave to the world of today by looking at some of its most characteristic words. \n\nProgramme one looks at what the memory of Baghdad means to Muslims in particular. It focuses on the caliph (literally, the succesor to the Prophet), the souk (the market, or downtown) and on fiqh (understanding and jurisprudence).","first_broadcast_date":"2009-05-30T05:32:30+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Belief In A Golden Age part 1"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0033458","title":"Song Of The Scallop","first_broadcast_date":"2009-05-23T05:32:30+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0037mgb","title":"Heart & Soul","first_broadcast_date":"2009-06-06T05:32:30+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p003545v","duration":1589,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p009g456","key":"abbasid_caliphate","title":"Abbasid Caliphate","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abbasid_Caliphate"},{"type":"place","id":"p007mg9q","key":"baghdad","title":"Baghdad","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baghdad"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g45f","key":"caliph","title":"Caliph","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caliph"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g45b","key":"caliphate","title":"Caliphate","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caliphate"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g45m","key":"fiqh","title":"Fiqh","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fiqh"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007l634","key":"islam","title":"Islam","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Islam"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g458","key":"islamic_golden_age","title":"Islamic Golden Age","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Islamic_Golden_Age"},{"type":"format","id":"PT009","key":"magazinesandreviews","title":"Magazines & Reviews","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g45k","key":"souk","title":"Souq","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Souq"}]}}
