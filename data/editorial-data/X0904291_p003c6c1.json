But one group has been more fortunate than others - the Somali Bantu, whose ancestors were taken to Somalia as slaves from southern Africa in the 19th Century. \nIn 2001 the Somali Bantu were recognised as an especially vulnerable group by the United States and two years later 12,000 of them were airlifted out of the camps and flown to new, permanent homes in the United States. Assignment's Tim Mansel visits one group of them in the western city of Boise in Idaho.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-06-18T09:06:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Assignment ","subtitle":"America's Somali Bantu"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn0","title":"Assignment ","short_synopsis":"Investigations and journeys into the heart of global events from BBC correspondents","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T11:06:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p003drb0","title":"12/06/2009","first_broadcast_date":"2009-06-12T01:05:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p003g5w7","title":"25/06/2009","first_broadcast_date":"2009-06-25T09:05:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p003c6f0","duration":1590,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"place","id":"p009bf1m","key":"boise%2C_idaho","title":"Boise, Idaho","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boise%2C_Idaho"},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"place","id":"p006tnjz","key":"idaho","title":"Idaho","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Idaho"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00079","key":"news","title":"News","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009bf19","key":"somali_bantu","title":"Somali Bantu","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Somali_Bantu"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009bf1h","key":"somali_civil_war","title":"Somali Civil War","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Somali_Civil_War"},{"type":"place","id":"p009bf1c","key":"somalia","title":"Somalia","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Somalia"}]}}
