We examine the unmarried life of the priest.","long_synopsis":"Celibacy \n\n“I wish that all were as I myself am” \nThe apostle Paul advocating what he believed to be the most holy state – celibate and devoted to God. \nBut when did celibacy become mandatory for the priesthood in the Catholic Church, and why is there a growing movement to have that rule over-turned. Heart and Soul examines the unmarried life of the priest in a two part series.\n\nThere are growing calls from Churches and congregations across South America and many European countries, including Germany and Ireland, to allow priests to marry. Heart and Soul talk to priests who have been forced to leave the church because they’ve broken their vow of chastity, and to their offspring, tainted by shame. \nWith the Catholic Church mired in several sexual abuse scandals around the world, critics are arguing that part of the blame lies with the continuing demand for celibacy. Heart and Soul examines whether celibacy is out-dated and talks to those both for and against its continuation.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-02T12:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Celibacy, Episode 2"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"series","pid":"p007qf2y","title":"Celibacy","short_synopsis":"","position":null,"expected_child_count":2,"first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-26T12:32:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p007qf48","title":"Episode 1","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-26T12:32:00+01:00","position":1,"media_type":null},"next":null},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p007tyly","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"organisation","id":"p009fqdd","key":"catholic_church","title":"Catholic Church","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholic_Church"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g4f0","key":"catholic_sex_abuse_cases","title":"Catholic sex abuse cases","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholic_sex_abuse_cases"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009gtsl","key":"celibacy","title":"Celibacy","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celibacy"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009gtsr","key":"chastity","title":"Chastity","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chastity"},{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion & Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007ltrp","key":"priesthood_(catholic_church)","title":"Priesthood (Catholic Church)","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Priesthood_%28Catholic_Church%29"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"place","id":"p006cm87","key":"south_america","title":"South America","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_America"}]}}
