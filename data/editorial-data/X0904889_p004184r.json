And yet surprisingly, they all have to be learnt. But some argue a wariness of snakes does not - instead, they say it is built into us all.\n\nSir David Attenborough takes issue with snakes, and takes us into the alien world of the underground. There, animals have evolved very differently; subterranean creatures have a different shape, different senses and are even different to the touch. \n\nSir David argues that the ancestor of snakes was an underground reptile and, as a result of its more recent evolution to live above ground, has given the species one very eerie characteristic that un-nerves him enormously. Tune in to find out what that is.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-08-29T11:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Letter From...","subtitle":"David Attenborough - 29/08/2009"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002wv05","title":"Letter From...","short_synopsis":"A topical audio essay by a leading commentator from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2009-01-03T18:06:00Z","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p003z494","title":"David Attenborough - 22/08/2009","first_broadcast_date":"2009-08-22T11:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0043kc4","title":"05/09/2009","first_broadcast_date":"2009-09-05T11:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p004186y","duration":480,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"person","id":"p0036t1w","key":"david_attenborough","title":"David Attenborough","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Attenborough"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00046","key":"artscultureandthemedia","title":"Arts, Culture & the Media","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p00377q2","key":"fossorial","title":"Fossorial","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fossorial"},{"type":"format","id":"PT013","key":"readings","title":"Readings","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007m63y","key":"reptile","title":"Reptile","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reptile"}]}}
