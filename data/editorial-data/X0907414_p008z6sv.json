But it's an idea that is under attack.\n\nPope Benedict, who is due to visit Britain in September, claims that we are now living in \"a dictatorship of relativism\" - a place where nothing is certain and we are all slaves to our own desires. But his critics say he is just confusing relativism with liberalism.\n\nEdward Stourton examines whether the tolerance which moral relativism is supposed to foster has in fact become a new form of extremism.\n\nHe speaks to the Archbishop of Canterbury and leader of the worldwide Anglican Communion, Dr Rowan Williams, and to the former Conservative government minister Ann Widdecombe, a convert to Catholicism.  \n\nWe also hear from the Italian politician and philosopher, Marcello Pera, philosophers Simon Blackburn, Leslie Green and Stephen Wang and the Sunni Islamic scholar Ruzwan Mohammed.\n\nClips from Pope Benedict XVI's speech, the inauguration of Pope Benedict XV1 and 'Litany of the Saints' from Vatican Radio.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-08-11T12:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"A Dictatorship of Relativism"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p008vd4f","title":"New Jewish Life in Berlin","first_broadcast_date":"2010-08-04T12:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0092pw0","title":"Recite!","first_broadcast_date":"2010-08-18T12:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p008z6wf","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"Download this episode (mp3)","url":"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/heartsoul/heartsoul_20100811-0300a.mp3"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"person","id":"p007lw8p","key":"ann_widdecombe","title":"Ann Widdecombe","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ann_Widdecombe"},{"type":"person","id":"p007lvlm","key":"archbishop_of_canterbury","title":"Archbishop of Canterbury","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archbishop_of_Canterbury"},{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion & Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"person","id":"p009j620","key":"leslie_green_(philosopher)","title":"Leslie Green (philosopher)","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leslie_Green_%28philosopher%29"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007mfs5","key":"liberalism","title":"Liberalism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liberalism"},{"type":"person","id":"p009j61w","key":"marcello_pera","title":"Marcello Pera","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcello_Pera"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009j61n","key":"moral_relativism","title":"Moral relativism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moral_relativism"},{"type":"person","id":"p007lvs9","key":"pope_benedict_xvi","title":"Pope Benedict XVI","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Benedict_XVI"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009j61j","key":"relativism","title":"Relativism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Relativism"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"person","id":"p0080wbk","key":"rowan_williams","title":"Rowan Williams","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rowan_Williams"},{"type":"person","id":"p009j61y","key":"simon_blackburn","title":"Simon Blackburn","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simon_Blackburn"}]}}
