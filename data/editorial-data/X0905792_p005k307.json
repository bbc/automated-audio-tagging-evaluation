And he found that wolves are returning, moving south towards the cities. Will Swedes be able to resist the urge to shoot them?","first_broadcast_date":"2009-12-31T12:32:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Crossing Continents","subtitle":"Sweden"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p0053dq2","title":"Crossing Continents","short_synopsis":"On the ground reporting from around the world","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2009-12-10T12:32:00Z","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p005ftzw","title":"Rio law","first_broadcast_date":"2009-12-24T12:32:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p005nhvg","title":"Sri Lanka's fragile peace ","first_broadcast_date":"2010-01-07T12:32:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p005k32s","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lkj3","key":"fishing","title":"Fishing","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fishing"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00079","key":"news","title":"News","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p00380jb","key":"summer","title":"Summer","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Summer"},{"type":"place","id":"p007m0td","key":"sweden","title":"Sweden","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sweden"}]}}
