In African football, traditional belief systems, such as juju, have long been associated with the game. \n\nBut new Christian movements are displacing juju in Africa. And everywhere they are showing signs of wanting to play a bigger role in football.\n\nBut FIFA would rather religion stayed out of football, and have warned they will not tolerate any expressions of religion, such as those professed by Kaka, on the pitch during this year's African Cup of Nations and World Cup.  \n\nIt argues football's power to unite could be threatened if it does not remain secular. \n\nBelow: Brazilian football player Kaka and his t-shirt which reads: \"I Belong To Jesus\".
