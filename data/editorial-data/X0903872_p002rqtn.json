Was it worth it?  The removal of Saddam Hussein was only one objective.  How secure are Iraq's democratic foundations?  And what of the hoped for domino effect in the region?  One British politician, Ann Clwyd, with a long involvement in Iraqi politics is hopeful of the future, but others remain unconvinced.  This special edition of Politics UK asks how history will judge the outcome of the war in Iraq.  Presented by Norman Smith.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-04-18T19:32:30+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Politics UK","subtitle":"18/04/2009"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn2","title":"Politics UK","short_synopsis":"A weekly look inside British politics from the BBC","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T14:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p002nrrt","title":"Politics UK","first_broadcast_date":"2009-04-11T19:32:30+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p002svv0","title":"25/04/2009","first_broadcast_date":"2009-04-25T19:32:30+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p002rqvz","duration":1589,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"Ann Clwyd, MP","url":"http://politics.guardian.co.uk/person/0,,-1008,00.html"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Nadim Shehadi","url":"http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/about/directory/view/-/id/23/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Professor Gareth Stansfield","url":"http://huss.exeter.ac.uk/iais/staff/stansfield/"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"genre","id":"C00063","key":"politics","title":"Politics","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lt8h","key":"history","title":"History","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/History"},{"type":"place","id":"p007m3hv","key":"iraq","title":"Iraq","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraq"},{"type":"format","id":"PT009","key":"magazinesandreviews","title":"Magazines & Reviews","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p006dc0p","key":"politics","title":"Politics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Politics"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lr8m","key":"war","title":"War","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/War"}]}}
