An island and a commonwealth, it exists in an uneasy relationship with its massive neighbour, the US. \n\nAll of its political powers, and much of its government cash, come from Washington, but Puerto Ricans can't vote in US federal elections. And now an economic crisis generated in the US has come home to roost on the island. \n\nPuerto Rico's Republican governor has announced a wave of layoffs of public sector workers, along with deep cuts in services. Students responded by staging the longest ever university strike in north American history. \n\nThis dispute plays into the bitter arguments over the island's status. Should it seek independence, and the right to make its own decisions? Or should it push for more integration into the US, so at least it has some say in its future?\n\nMaria Hinojosa, the distinguished journalist and presenter of Latino USA, travels to the island to examine its future through the voices of young people. \n\nShe meets the students who so furiously defied the governor and hears from young activists who are pushing for independence. And she seeks out one of the many young Puerto Ricans who are signing up to serve in the US military - and who see their primary loyalty on the mainland.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-07-29T12:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Crossing Continents","subtitle":"Puerto Rico"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p0053dq2","title":"Crossing Continents","short_synopsis":"On the ground reporting from around the world","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2009-12-10T12:32:00Z","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p007k3v5","title":"13/05/2010","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-13T12:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p008w7jt","title":"Madagascar","first_broadcast_date":"2010-08-05T12:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p008rnxj","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[{"title":"Maria Hinojosa presents Latino USA","content":"Maria Hinojosa is an award-winning American journalist and presenter.
