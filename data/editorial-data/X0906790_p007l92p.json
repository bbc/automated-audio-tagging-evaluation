Many scientists distrust the traditional lie detectors, like the polygraph with its wires and electrodes stuck to the skin, and say they never reliably reveal a liar. But now companies are marketing voice stress analysers and even brain scanners to do ‘truth verification’. Roland Pease investigates whether the new technologies are any better than the old ones?","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-19T10:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Discovery","subtitle":"Would I Lie To You?, Episode 2"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"series","pid":"p007gvgd","title":"Would I Lie To You?","short_synopsis":"","position":null,"expected_child_count":2,"first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-12T10:32:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002w557","title":"Discovery","short_synopsis":"Explores today's most significant scientific discoveries.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-14T10:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p007gvhg","title":"Episode 1","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-12T10:32:00+01:00","position":1,"media_type":null},"next":null},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p007l956","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p009hkff","key":"deception","title":"Deception","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deception"},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00064","key":"scienceandnature","title":"Science & Nature","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007m2fy","key":"lie","title":"Lie","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lie"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009hkfb","key":"polygraph","title":"Polygraph","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polygraph"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lyl5","key":"truth","title":"Truth","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Truth"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009hkfv","key":"voice_stress_analysis","title":"Voice stress analysis","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voice_stress_analysis"}]}}
