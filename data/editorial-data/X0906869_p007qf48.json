We examine the unmarried life of the priest.","long_synopsis":"“I wish that all were as I myself am” \nThe apostle Paul advocating what he believed to be the most holy state – celibate and devoted to God. \nBut when did celibacy become mandatory for the priesthood in the Catholic Church, and why is there a growing movement to have that rule over-turned. Heart and Soul examines the unmarried life of the priest in a two part series.\n\nThe priestly vow to remain continent and chaste is not set down as a rule in the Bible, and the earliest Christian leaders were largely married men.  Heart and Soul explores how the Church came to outlaw sexual relations for its priests. And we talk candidly to priests who have sacrificed married life for the “sake of the Kingdom”.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-26T12:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Celibacy, Episode 1"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"series","pid":"p007qf2y","title":"Celibacy","short_synopsis":"","position":null,"expected_child_count":2,"first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-26T12:32:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}}}},"peers":{"previous":null,"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p007tyj8","title":"Episode 2","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-02T12:32:00+01:00","position":2,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p007qf6v","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"organisation","id":"p009fqdd","key":"catholic_church","title":"Catholic Church","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholic_Church"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009gtsl","key":"celibacy","title":"Celibacy","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celibacy"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009gtsr","key":"chastity","title":"Chastity","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chastity"},{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion & Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007ltrp","key":"priesthood_(catholic_church)","title":"Priesthood (Catholic Church)","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Priesthood_%28Catholic_Church%29"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
