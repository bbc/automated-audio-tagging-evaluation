His first two novels Five Point Someone and One Night at the Call Centre have already become Bollywood films. \n\nLast year Chetan Bhagat was able to give up international banking to become a writer full-time, but it wasn’t easy for him to leave behind the bank’s pay-cheque and Mercedes. While he counsels against pure materialism, he does it through buddy novels and romantic comedies, not wanting to be preachy because he knows how ineffective that is.\n\nBrought up as a Hindu, Bhagat lists 'Spirituality' as one of his primary interests. In his fiction God may come on the phone to help sort out everyone's troubles, but religion is also shown in Chetan Bhagat’s work to be divisive and violent when manipulated.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-02-03T12:32:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Spiritual Journeys, Episode 2"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"series","pid":"p005x3tz","title":"Spiritual Journeys","short_synopsis":"","position":null,"expected_child_count":3,"first_broadcast_date":"2010-01-27T12:32:00Z","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p005x3wj","title":"Anne Rice","first_broadcast_date":"2010-01-27T12:32:00Z","position":1,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0062ygx","title":"Episode 3","first_broadcast_date":"2010-02-10T12:32:00Z","position":3,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p005zyrb","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"www.chetanbhagat.com","url":"http://www.chetanbhagat.com/"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p009g7x6","key":"bollywood","title":"Bollywood","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bollywood"},{"type":"person","id":"p009g7x0","key":"chetan_bhagat","title":"Chetan Bhagat","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chetan_Bhagat"},{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion & Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lw0b","key":"hinduism","title":"Hinduism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hinduism"},{"type":"place","id":"p003vbdv","key":"india","title":"India","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/India"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007ltrm","key":"spirituality","title":"Spirituality","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spirituality"}]}}
