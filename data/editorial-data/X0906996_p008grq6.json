But as Dr. Stuart Brown director of the US’s National Institute for Play illustrates, play is anything but trivial. \n\nIt is a biological drive as integral to our health as sleep or nutrition. In this programme he takes us on a journey through the laboratory and into the playground to investigate how and why, human play evolved.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-07-07T10:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Discovery","subtitle":"Seriously fun"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002w557","title":"Discovery","short_synopsis":"Explores today's most significant scientific discoveries.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-14T10:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0088v2l","title":"Waging War on Viruses","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-30T10:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p008rnrs","title":"Dangers in the Dust","first_broadcast_date":"2010-07-21T10:32:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p008grst","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"Download this episode (mp3)","url":"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/discovery/discovery_20100707-1143a.mp3"},{"type":"related_site","title":"The National Institute for Play","url":"http://www.nifplay.org/index.html"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00064","key":"scienceandnature","title":"Science & Nature","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lr3h","key":"health","title":"Health","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009j65n","key":"play_(activity)","title":"Play (activity)","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28activity%29"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009j65t","key":"recreation","title":"Recreation","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Recreation"}]}}
