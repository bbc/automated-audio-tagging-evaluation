What do genes extracted from fossil Neanderthal bones add to the story of our origins? \n\nThese are some of the questions which evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins explores in the second part of this series, marking the 10th anniversary of the sequencing of the human genome.\n\nIn June 2000, scientists of the Human Genome Project announced that they had worked out the three billion genetic letter code of the human body. Since then, many other animals have had their genomes decoded. The list includes the mouse, dog, the duck-billed platypus, the chicken and the chimpanzee, to name but a few. Comparing the As, Gs, Cs and Ts in our genome with those of other animals allows scientists to illuminate the story of our ancestors' evolution with extraordinary insights.\n\nThe techniques for processing and decoding DNA have become so advanced that it is now even possible to reconstruct the complete genetic code of creatures which died tens of thousands of years. This has been done for our closest evolutionary cousins, the Neanderthals, by extracting shattered DNA fragments from 40,000 year old bones and piecing them together. The leader of this project, Svante Paabo, says it still \"blows his mind\" when he thinks about what it's now possible to do with ancient DNA.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-08-04T10:32:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Discovery","subtitle":"Age Of The Genome, Episode 2"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"series","pid":"p008r4k1","title":"Age Of The Genome","short_synopsis":"","position":null,"expected_child_count":4,"first_broadcast_date":"2010-07-28T10:32:00+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002w557","title":"Discovery","short_synopsis":"Explores today's most significant scientific discoveries.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-14T10:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p008r4l4","title":"Episode 1","first_broadcast_date":"2010-07-28T10:32:00+01:00","position":1,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p008z6sl","title":"Episode 3","first_broadcast_date":"2010-08-11T10:32:00+01:00","position":3,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p008vd6t","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"BBC News: Neanderthal genes ‘survive in us’ ","url":"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8660940.stm"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Katherine Pollard's Research Group","url":"http://docpollard.com/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Radio 4 Frontiers: Neanderthal DNA","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/frontiers_20071121.shtml"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Richard Dawkins","url":"http://richarddawkins.net/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"The Carroll Laboratory","url":"http://www.molbio.wisc.edu/carroll/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"The Neandertal Genome Project","url":"http://www.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/index.html"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"subject","id":"p007mbgp","key":"dna","title":"DNA","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/DNA"},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009gvz8","key":"evolutionary_biology","title":"Evolutionary biology","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evolutionary_biology"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00191","key":"scienceandtechnology","title":"Science & Technology","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00064","key":"scienceandnature","title":"Science & Nature","broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p008m8rd","key":"genome","title":"Genome","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genome"},{"type":"subject","id":"p008m8rf","key":"genomics","title":"Genomics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genomics"},{"type":"subject","id":"p008m8rg","key":"human_genome","title":"Human genome","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_genome"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009j6f8","key":"human_genome_project","title":"Human Genome Project","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_Genome_Project"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009j6w8","key":"neanderthal","title":"Neanderthal","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neanderthal"},{"type":"person","id":"p008m8rh","key":"richard_dawkins","title":"Richard Dawkins","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Dawkins"}]}}
