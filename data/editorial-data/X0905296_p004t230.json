Or keep their terrible secret?","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-28T12:32:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Bosnia's War Babies, Episode 1"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"series","pid":"p004t21g","title":"Bosnia's War Babies","short_synopsis":"","position":null,"expected_child_count":2,"first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-28T12:32:00Z","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}}}},"peers":{"previous":null,"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p004t4ft","title":"Episode 2","first_broadcast_date":"2009-11-04T12:32:00Z","position":2,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p004t25k","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"place","id":"p007mpb5","key":"bosnia-hercegovina","title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g6rn","key":"bosnian_war","title":"Bosnian War","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosnian_War"},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"organisation","id":"p009g6t7","key":"international_court_of_justice","title":"International Court of Justice","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Court_of_Justice"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00079","key":"news","title":"News","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g6t5","key":"radovan_karadÅ¾iÄ?","title":"Radovan KaradÅ¾iÄ?","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radovan_KaradÅ¾iÄ?"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lkzl","key":"rape","title":"Rape","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rape"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007m6v9","key":"war_crime","title":"War crime","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/War_crime"}]}}
