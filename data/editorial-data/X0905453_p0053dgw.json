and Mimi Sheffer, who came to Berlin to conquer the operatic stage, but instead gave her voice to God.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-11-18T12:32:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"New Jewish life in Berlin 18/11/2009"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p004v8xt","title":"Open to All 11/11/2009","first_broadcast_date":"2009-11-11T12:32:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0053gbp","title":"The Black Cube 25/11/2009","first_broadcast_date":"2009-11-25T12:32:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0053dkf","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"Chabad Berlin (in English)","url":"http://www.chabadberlin.de/Default_cdo/lang/en"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Gilad Hochman, composer","url":"http://www.giladhochman.com/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Jewish Community in Berlin (in German)","url":"http://www.jg-berlin.org/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Lauder Yeshurun (in English)","url":"http://www.lauderyeshurun.de/en"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Mimi Sheffer, singer and cantor","url":"http://www.mimisheffer.com/"}],"supporting_content_items":[{"title":"Israeli composer Gilad Hochman at work in Berlin","content":"","link_title":"","link_uri":"","emp_playlist_uri":null,"emp_type":"video","published_image_uri":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/i/b4/a2/3edd312ec3f83459b95085f6f39fae11ae53.jpg","layout_arrangement":"image","position":0}],"available_clips":[],"categories":[{"type":"place","id":"p007lrhp","key":"berlin","title":"Berlin","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lm4c","key":"berlin_wall","title":"Berlin Wall","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin_Wall"},{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion & Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"format","id":"PT006","key":"documentaries","title":"Documentaries","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lm4f","key":"fall_of_the_berlin_wall","title":"Fall of the Berlin Wall","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fall_of_the_Berlin_Wall"},{"type":"place","id":"p006b8wq","key":"germany","title":"Germany","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany"},{"type":"person","id":"p009g72x","key":"gilad_hochman","title":"Gilad Hochman","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gilad_Hochman"},{"type":"subject","id":"p009g72v","key":"history_of_the_jews_in_germany","title":"History of the Jews in Germany","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_the_Jews_in_Germany"},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lqy3","key":"judaism","title":"Judaism","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judaism"},{"type":"genre","id":"C00080","key":"religionandethics","title":"Religion & Ethics","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"subject","id":"p007lm62","key":"holocaust","title":"The Holocaust","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":true,"sameAs":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Holocaust"}]}}
