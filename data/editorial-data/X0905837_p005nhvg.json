But there are controversial claims that triumphant Sinhalese are \"colonising\" prime land after the military victory.\n\nCharles investigates these claims to uncover the complex reality of political and ethnic relations over land.\n\nHe speaks to ordinary Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese and asks who are the winners and losers in \"colonisation\" of new areas?\n\nIt is a climate of fear in which some warn the situation in places like Kaviliyamadu could lead to more conflict.\n\nHis journey ends in Sri Lanka's prosperous south - heartland of the Sinhalese majority - where he meets the Venerable Omalpe Sobitha Thero, one of a movement of Buddhist monks whose theology was credited with spurring on the military offensive.\n\nThe army's conduct brought widespread international censure. But as Sri Lanka turns away from its former Western allies, who criticised its conduct of the war, the new regional superpower China is helping to built a vast new port facility at Hambantota - the President's home town.\n\nCharles gains exclusive access to the port and explores rumours that it may one day have a military purpose.\n\nHe travels around the island nation to ask: can the government and army that won the war, now win the peace?","first_broadcast_date":"2010-01-07T12:32:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Crossing Continents","subtitle":"Sri Lanka's fragile peace "},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p0053dq2","title":"Crossing Continents","short_synopsis":"On the ground reporting from around the world","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2009-12-10T12:32:00Z","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p005k307","title":"Sweden","first_broadcast_date":"2009-12-31T12:32:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p005rc0r","title":"Uganda: Battling the Witch-Doctors ","first_broadcast_date":"2010-01-14T12:32:00Z","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p005nhy0","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[{"title":"SUBSCRIBE TO THE CROSSING CONTINENTS","content":"Don't miss an episode of Crossing Continents, by subscribing to the free podcast.
