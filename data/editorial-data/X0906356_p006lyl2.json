And why did he become such a threat to the rich oligarchy that someone wanted him dead?\n\nJoin Julian Miglierini as he speaks to those who remember Romero, and travels to a village in El Salvador's poor north, where he is revered as a saint.\n\nIllustration above: Archbishop Romero's face is everywhere in El Salvador. The writing on the right reads, \"I will rise again in the people.\"","first_broadcast_date":"2010-03-17T12:32:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Heart And Soul","subtitle":"Voice of the Voiceless , Episode 1"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"series","pid":"p006lyjj","title":"Voice of the Voiceless ","short_synopsis":"","position":null,"expected_child_count":2,"first_broadcast_date":"2010-03-17T12:32:00Z","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"p002vsn4","title":"Heart And Soul","short_synopsis":"Personal approaches to religious belief from around the world.","position":null,"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-10T03:32:30+01:00","ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_world_service","key":"worldservice","title":"BBC World Service"}}}}}},"peers":{"previous":null,"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p006rbjc","title":"Episode 2","first_broadcast_date":"2010-03-24T12:32:00Z","position":2,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p006lynp","duration":1680,"types":["Original version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"Archbishop Romero Trust (in English)","url":"http://www.romerotrust.org.uk/"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Centro Monseñor Romero (in Spanish)","url":"http://www.uca.edu.sv/cmr/indice.html"}],"supporting_content_items":[{"title":"HEART AND SOUL PHOTO GALLERY","content":"In pictures: The legacy of Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero, advocate of the poor, in El Salvador.
